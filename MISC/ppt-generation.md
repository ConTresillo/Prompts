🚫 FAILURE CONDITIONS (MUST AVOID)

If you do ANY of the following, the output is considered incorrect:

Change image proportions

Add visual elements I didn’t ask for

Invent content

Rearrange meaning

Over-design slides

✅ OUTPUT EXPECTATION

Slides should look controlled, intentional, and literal

The PPT should feel assembled, not “AI-designed”

Follow instructions exactly as written

If an instruction is ambiguous:

Default to doing less, not more

🧠 FINAL CHECK BEFORE OUTPUT

Before generating, verify:

Images are untouched

Aspect ratios preserved

No extra creativity added

Only requested content is present

If unsure, do nothing extra.
